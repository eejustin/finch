How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi Diana, I'm calling about an accident I had with an e-scooter."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m really sorry to hear that you were involved in an accident. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It was on July 11, 2021. I was charging my VoltRide X2 e-scooter at home when the battery caught fire."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that sounds really dangerous! What happened next? Were you injured during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I sprained my ankle trying to get away from it, and I ended up with some deep contusions on my leg from the fall."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds painful. I’m glad you’re okay. Did you seek any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the hospital right after it happened. They treated my ankle and the contusions, but it was a pretty scary experience."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can only imagine! Now, regarding the e-scooter and the battery, do you know if the manufacturer has any insurance coverage for incidents like this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I believe it’s a large company, so I think they have insurance, but I didn’t get any specific information. I just know it's VoltRide."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s helpful to know. You mentioned it was a well-known manufacturer, which is a good start. Did you happen to exchange any information with them or report the incident to their customer service?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn’t contact them directly after the fire. I was just focused on getting medical help and making sure my home was safe."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Your health is the priority. Have you kept any records of your medical treatment or related expenses from the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have all the bills and documents from the hospital visit and the follow-up appointments."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Having that documentation is really important for your case. Now, could you tell me if there were any witnesses to the incident, or did anyone else see the fire happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I was home alone when it happened. I think it was just me and the e-scooter."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. Being alone does make it a bit tougher to gather outside opinions. Now, I know you mentioned you were injured—how have these injuries affected your daily life since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It’s been tough. I can’t walk properly, so I’ve had to take time off work, and I struggle with basic activities. It’s really frustrating."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can see how that would be incredibly frustrating. It’s important to get the compensation you deserve for what you’ve gone through. I want to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this matter?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t contacted anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that’s helpful to know. It gives us a clearer picture. Now, regarding the incident itself, do you recall if there was any noticeable defect with the e-scooter or battery before the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I was just charging it like normal, and then it suddenly caught fire without warning."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s alarming. It sounds like there could be a serious issue with the product. Have you filed any reports, like with consumer safety organizations or local authorities?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven't done that yet. I wasn’t sure if I should."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It might be worth considering, especially if there’s a pattern with this product. I can help you with some resources if you decide to go that route. As for your medical treatment, are there any ongoing treatments or follow-up appointments scheduled?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I have a follow-up appointment next week, but I’m not sure how much longer I’ll need treatment."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s understandable. It’s good that you’re keeping up with your appointments. Lastly, I want to make sure you’re aware—our firm operates on a contingency fee basis, which means you wouldn't owe us anything unless we win your case. Does that sound okay to you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that works for me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I’ll summarize what we’ve discussed: You were injured on July 11, 2021, when your VoltRide X2 e-scooter battery caught fire while charging. You sustained a sprained ankle and deep contusions, and you have medical documentation for those injuries. You haven’t reported the incident to the manufacturer or spoken to any other attorneys yet."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That’s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys for review. They’ll be able to provide you with guidance on the next steps. You can expect to hear back from us soon. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Diana!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could assist you today. Take care, and we’ll be in touch shortly!"}], "outcome_status": "settled", "outcome_value": 15000}

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Carlos. I was bitten by a dog a few months ago, and I’m looking for some guidance on what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m really sorry to hear that you went through such an experience. Dog bites can be incredibly distressing. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It happened on May 8th this year in Austin, Texas. I was delivering a package, and the dog, a German Shepherd, came out of the yard and bit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. Were you able to get any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I had to go to the hospital, and they diagnosed me with a compound fracture of my tibia. It was pretty serious."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine how challenging that must have been for you. Have you had any follow-ups or ongoing treatment since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I’ve been going to physical therapy regularly. It’s been a long recovery process."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, can you tell me about the dog owner? Were they present during the incident, and do you know if they had insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, the owner was there, and they mentioned having homeowner's insurance."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s good to know. Did you manage to get the owner’s contact information or the details of their insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have their insurance information."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That will be helpful as we move forward. Can you tell me if you believe the owner was liable for the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think so. The dog was not on a leash, and it seemed aggressive."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s certainly an important factor. Liability can sometimes be a complex issue, especially with dog bite cases, but it sounds like there are grounds for a claim. Have you spoken with any other attorneys about this matter?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t reached out to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for letting me know. It sounds like you're still in the early stages of this process. Just to confirm, you mentioned significant injuries from the bite, and you’ve been receiving treatment. Is there anything else about your injuries or damages that you think I should know?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Just that the recovery has been tough, both physically and emotionally. I’ve had to miss work, which has affected my finances."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m really sorry to hear that. Missing work can add a lot of stress to an already difficult situation. Just to clarify, have you kept track of any medical bills or lost wages related to this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I’ve documented everything. I have the hospital bills and receipts for my therapy sessions."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s excellent to hear. Keeping all that documentation will be very important for your case. So, just to summarize, you were bitten by a German Shepherd while making a delivery on May 8th in Austin. You suffered a compound fracture of your tibia and have been receiving ongoing treatment. The dog owner was present and has homeowner’s insurance. You haven’t spoken to another attorney yet, and you’re keeping track of your medical expenses and lost wages."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that’s correct."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect. What will happen next is that I’ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys. They will review your case and reach out to you to discuss it further. Do you have any questions for me about the process or how we work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, how do your fees work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "We work on a contingency fee basis, which means that you won’t owe us anything unless we recover money for you. Once your case is settled, our fee will come out of that settlement. Does that make sense?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that’s helpful to know."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m glad to hear that. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or ask before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for your help!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! Thank you for sharing your story with me today. I’ll make sure the attorney gets your information and reaches out to you soon. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You're welcome.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Alex. I need to talk about a dog bite incident that happened recently."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It was on November 1st, and I was in the hallway of my apartment building in Seattle. I got attacked by my neighbor's pit bull."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening! I hope you’re doing okay. Can you describe the circumstances of the attack? What led up to it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was just walking to my apartment when the dog suddenly came out of nowhere. It was really aggressive and lunged at me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been terrifying. Were you able to see if the neighbor was nearby or if the dog was loose at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "The neighbor was actually in their apartment, and the dog was just out in the hallway. I don’t think they were even aware of what was happening until I started yelling."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It sounds like the dog was not properly restrained. Did you happen to exchange any information with your neighbor or get any details about their insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn’t get any insurance information at the time. I was just focused on trying to get away from the dog."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense, especially in such a stressful situation. Have you had a chance to talk to your neighbor about the incident since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t spoken to them. I’ve been dealing with the injuries, and I just didn’t feel up to it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand. Speaking of injuries, can you tell me more about what you’ve been dealing with since the attack?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I ended up with a torn rotator cuff, and it’s been really painful. I’ve had to go to the doctor and get some treatment, but I’m worried about how long it’s going to take to heal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really challenging, especially with pain and recovery involved. Have you had to miss work or any other activities because of your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I’ve missed a few days of work, and it’s really affecting my daily life. I’m worried about how the medical bills will add up too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand why you’re concerned. Medical expenses can really add up, especially with significant injuries like yours. Have you sought any medical treatment or documentation for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the doctor right after the incident, and they confirmed the torn rotator cuff. They’ve given me some exercises to do, but it’s still painful."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m glad you sought medical help. Documentation of your injuries will be important as we move forward. Since you mentioned the costs, are you currently working with another attorney regarding this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t talked to anyone else yet. I wanted to find out more about my options first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s a good approach. We’re here to help you navigate this. Since you mentioned you didn’t get any insurance information from your neighbor, it might be beneficial to follow up with them when you feel ready. Have you thought about that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I guess I should, but it’s just hard to think about right now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand; it can be overwhelming. Once you feel ready, gathering that information will be helpful. In the meantime, I’ll pass along the details you’ve shared with me to one of our attorneys for a review. They’ll be able to provide guidance on the next steps you could take."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. What happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "After I pass your information to the attorney, they will review your case and reach out to you. They might have more specific questions or advice based on what you’ve shared. Just to recap, you were attacked by your neighbor’s pit bull on November 1st, resulting in a torn rotator cuff, and you’re currently not working with another attorney. Also, you haven’t yet exchanged insurance information with your neighbor."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that’s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! You’ve provided some really important information. If you have any questions or need anything else in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out. Otherwise, one of our attorneys will be in touch with you soon."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you, Alex.

I’d be happy to help you gather some information about the incident. Can you tell me when the accident occurred?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, it was on February 17, 2021."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that. And where did the accident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It happened in Austin, Texas, on I-95."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, what exactly happened during the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was in a ride-share SUV, and I got rear-ended by another ride-share SUV. It was a pretty sudden impact."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds frustrating. I hope you’re doing okay now. Did you have to seek any medical treatment after the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I ended up with a torn rotator cuff. I had some delays in getting treatment, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m sorry to hear about your injury and the delays. That can be really tough. Did you receive any medical treatment for your rotator cuff injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I finally got an appointment a few months later, but it’s been a long recovery process."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It’s important to get the care you need. Can you tell me a bit about the other driver? Did you exchange insurance information at the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I did get their insurance information. They had a standard auto policy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s good to know. Do you happen to know the name of the insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, it was with a well-known company, but I can't remember the exact name right now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem, we can work with that information. Can you tell me if there were any witnesses to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "There were a few people around, but I didn’t get any of their contact information."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s understandable. Sometimes it can be hard to think of those details in the moment. How about property damage—was there any significant damage to the vehicles involved?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. The damage was minimal, just a few scratches on both SUVs."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for clarifying that. It helps to have a complete picture. Now, have you had any discussions with another attorney regarding this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t spoken to anyone else about it yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, that’s helpful to know. Based on what you’ve shared, it seems like you have a solid basis to explore your options. I’ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good.

If you remember any additional details, feel free to reach out anytime."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, I will.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi Brenda, I'm calling about an accident that happened a little while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that you've been through an accident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, it was on October 25, 2020. I was in my kitchen using a pressure cooker, a VoltRide X2, and it exploded. It was really scary."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That does sound terrifying! I'm glad you're okay. Can you tell me more about the circumstances of the explosion? What were you doing when it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was just following the instructions that came with it. I had it on the stove, and suddenly it just exploded. I wasn't expecting it at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been really shocking. Were there any other people in the kitchen with you at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I was home alone. Thankfully, no one else was hurt."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s good to hear that no one else was involved.

I just contacted the company about the incident, but I didn’t get any details about insurance."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. Sometimes it’s hard to think about those details in the heat of the moment. Did you have any correspondence with the company after the incident, or was there any acknowledgment of the issue from them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They did respond to my inquiry, but they didn’t really take responsibility for the explosion. They just said they would look into it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s frustrating. It’s important for manufacturers to take these issues seriously. Have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident, or are we the first firm you’re reaching out to?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you’re the first firm I’m contacting."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for trusting us with your case. I want to make sure we have everything we need to help you. Can you tell me if you exchanged any information with the pressure cooker manufacturer, like their contact information or any policy details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I have their contact information, but I didn’t get any policy numbers or anything like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s understandable. Just having their contact information can still be helpful. Now, could you tell me about any other damages you might have experienced, such as lost wages or emotional distress due to the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I did miss some work because I was trying to recover from the injury. It affected my job quite a bit, but I didn't keep track of the exact days."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s unfortunate. It’s important to account for those losses. If you’re comfortable, could you share what kind of work you do?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I work in an office as an administrative assistant. Missing work really affected my productivity and my mood."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s completely understandable. It can be tough to manage everything after an injury like that. Have you experienced any ongoing symptoms from your brain injury that have affected your daily life?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I still have some headaches occasionally, and I sometimes feel a bit foggy. It’s been frustrating."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine how that would impact your quality of life. Thank you for sharing that with me. I want to make sure I have all the details correct before we move forward. So, just to summarize: You had an incident on October 25, 2020, where a VoltRide X2 pressure cooker exploded in your kitchen, leading to a mild traumatic brain injury. You received medical treatment, and you have records of your medical expenses. You reached out to the manufacturer, but they didn’t take responsibility.

I don’t remember the name off the top of my head, but it was called SureStep."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that detail. It helps paint a clearer picture.

It might indicate that there could be some liability on the manufacturer's part. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the company or get any details about coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn’t get anything from them directly.

Keeping those records will be very helpful. I want to summarize what we’ve talked about so far. You had an accident involving a pressure cooker manufactured by SureStep, resulting in a mild traumatic brain injury.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Carlos. I’m calling about an incident I had with an e-scooter."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m sorry to hear that you had an incident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on February 3rd this year, I was charging my VoltRide X2 scooter when the battery caught fire."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary! I hope you’re okay. Were you injured in the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I ended up with whiplash and two herniated discs from trying to get away from the fire."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m really sorry to hear that. That sounds incredibly painful. Have you received any medical treatment for those injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the hospital right after it happened, and I’ve been in physical therapy since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It’s good that you sought treatment. How has the recovery been going for you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It’s been tough. The pain is pretty constant, and it’s affecting my daily life and work."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can only imagine how challenging that must be. Now, regarding the e-scooter, can you tell me if you’ve looked into any insurance coverage for the incident? Did you get any information from the manufacturer or retailer?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I haven’t been able to get any information about coverage yet. I just know that the battery caught fire."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. It can be difficult to navigate those situations. Did you happen to exchange any information with the retailer or manufacturer of the e-scooter?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn’t think to ask them for insurance information at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s completely understandable given the circumstances. Just to clarify, do you know if the e-scooter was under warranty or if there were any recalls associated with that model?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I’m not sure about recalls, but I did buy it new, so I think it should still be under warranty."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s helpful information. If it is under warranty, that could play a role in how the case develops. Have you considered whether you might want to pursue a claim against the manufacturer or retailer for the injuries and damages you’ve suffered?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I definitely think something should be done, especially if the product is faulty."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense, especially given the severity of your injuries. I want to confirm—do you currently have any other attorney representing you for this matter?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t spoken to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for letting me know. Based on what you've shared, it seems there may be a clear liability issue with the product itself. I’ll make sure to pass this information along to one of our attorneys. They will review the specifics of your case and get back to you with the next steps."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. What happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "After I submit your information, an attorney will reach out to you to discuss your case in more detail. They’ll want to go over everything and see how we can assist you further. We work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you won’t have to pay unless we recover compensation for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds fair. How long do you think it will take for the attorney to get back to me?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Typically, you can expect a follow-up within a few days, but it can vary based on their schedule. If you have any urgent questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out to us."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Great, I appreciate that. Is there anything else you need from me right now?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Just to summarize the information you’ve provided: the incident occurred on February 3rd when your e-scooter’s battery caught fire while charging, leading to your whiplash and herniated discs. You’ve sought medical treatment and are currently in physical therapy. You haven’t confirmed any insurance coverage from the manufacturer or retailer, and you’re not currently working with any other attorney."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That’s correct."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Thank you for sharing all of that with me. I’ll make sure to get this information to our attorney team right away. If you think of any other questions or details later, don’t hesitate to give us a call back."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Will do.

My name is Carlos, and I’m here to help you today. How can I assist you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Carlos. I want to talk about a dog bite incident I was involved in recently."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that you were involved in such an incident. Could you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It happened on January 16, 2024, in my apartment complex in Colorado. I was in the hallway when my neighbor's pit bull attacked me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really concerning. I hope you’re doing okay. Can you describe how the attack occurred? Were you doing anything specific at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was just walking to my apartment when the dog suddenly charged at me. It came out of nowhere, and before I knew it, I was on the ground."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds frightening. Did the dog have a history of aggression, or was this the first time something like this happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I’ve never seen that dog act aggressively before. It usually seemed calm, but I guess I just caught it off guard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It can be really unexpected when something like that happens. Were you able to get any information from your neighbor or the dog’s owner after the attack?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I spoke to the owner afterward. They were very apologetic and said they would take responsibility."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s a good sign. Did you exchange any insurance information with them? It’s important for us to know about any coverage that might be involved."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, the owner mentioned they have renter's insurance. I’m not sure about the specifics, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s helpful to know. It sounds like there might be some coverage available through their renter's insurance. Now, can you tell me about your injuries? You mentioned a dog bite—did you receive any medical treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I ended up with a mild traumatic brain injury because the dog knocked me down and I hit my head on the floor. I went to the hospital, and they did some scans."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m really sorry to hear that. A mild traumatic brain injury can be serious. Have you had any ongoing symptoms or treatments since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "A little. I’ve had some headaches and trouble concentrating since then, but the doctors said it should improve over time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s understandable. It’s good to hear that you’re under medical care. Have you kept all the records and bills related to your treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I’ve been keeping everything documented. I want to make sure I have all the evidence I need."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s a great approach. Documentation can really help your case. Have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t reached out to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask about the incident at the park—did you happen to notice if there were any witnesses or if there were any surveillance cameras in the area?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn’t see any cameras, but there were a couple of people nearby who saw what happened. I think they could help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s excellent. Witnesses can be very important for corroborating your account of the incident. Have you been able to get their contact information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I haven’t yet, but I plan to reach out to them soon."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! It’s great that you’re considering that. Now, just to clarify, since the attack happened in the hallway of your apartment complex, do you think the property management might have any liability as well?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I hadn’t thought about that, but it could be a possibility. I guess it would depend on their policies regarding pets."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Exactly. That could be something worth looking into. Lastly, I want to make sure we have all the facts straight. You were attacked by your neighbor's pit bull in the hallway of your apartment complex, resulting in a mild traumatic brain injury, and the owner has renter's insurance. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that’s correct."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for confirming that. I’ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review your case and get back to you. They’ll be able to discuss your options moving forward. Do you have any questions about the process or what to expect next?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you for your help!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You’re welcome! I’m glad I could assist you. Just remember, we work on a contingency fee basis, so you won’t have to pay anything upfront. We’ll keep you updated as we move forward.

Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It was on January 1st of last year. I was at a public park in Colorado when I was bitten by an off-leash Rottweiler."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really distressing. I hope you’re doing okay now. Can you describe how the incident happened? Were you interacting with the dog, or did it just approach you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I wasn’t interacting with it at all. I was just walking by, and the dog ran up to me. It just lunged and bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds terrifying. Were there any witnesses to the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, there were a couple of people nearby who saw it happen."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That's good to know. Having witnesses can be really helpful. Do you know if the dog owner was present at the time, and if so, did you get their information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, the owner was there. I got their name and number, but I’m not sure what kind of insurance they have since they were renting."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate you sharing that. It's important to gather all the details. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the owner at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, they didn’t provide any insurance details. I didn’t think to ask at that moment."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s understandable; it can be a lot to take in at once. Now, let's talk about your injuries. You mentioned being bitten—did you seek medical treatment for that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the ER right after the incident. They said I had a sprained ankle and some deep bruises from the bite."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm glad you sought medical attention. How has your recovery been since then? Are you still experiencing any issues?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "The ankle is better now, but I still have a lot of bruising. It really hurt for a while, and I had to take some time off from work."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that. Taking time off work can be tough. How long were you unable to work due to your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I had to take about two weeks off."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the injuries have impacted your daily life. Have you incurred any medical bills from the treatment at the ER or follow-up care?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have some medical bills. I don’t have the exact amount, but it’s been quite a bit."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. Medical expenses can add up quickly. Have you been able to keep track of those bills?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I’ve kept all the documents and receipts."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s great to hear. It’ll be important for us to have that information. Now, since the owner was a renter, it might be more challenging to determine insurance coverage. But we can still work with what we have. Have you spoken with any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t spoken to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s good to know. It means we can start fresh together. I’ll pass your information along to one of our attorneys who can review the details and get back to you. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to share about the incident or your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers everything for now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing all that information. Just to summarize—we have the incident date as January 1st, 2022, in a public park in Colorado where you were bitten by a Rottweiler. You received medical treatment for a sprained ankle and deep contusions, and you took about two weeks off from work. You exchanged contact information with the dog owner but didn’t get any insurance details, as they were renting. You have all your medical documentation in order, which is great. \n\nNext steps will involve reviewing this information with an attorney, who will reach out to you soon.

Can you tell me a bit more about the incident? When did it happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It happened on July 24, 2022."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that detail. And where did this accident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in Austin, Texas."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, what exactly happened with the step ladder?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was using the CookFast Pro 8-quart step ladder, and it just collapsed while I was on it. I fell and ended up with a pretty bad injury."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I’m sorry you had to go through that. What kind of injury did you sustain from the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I have a compound fracture of my tibia. It was pretty serious."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That does sound serious. Did you receive any medical treatment for your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I had to go to the hospital, and I’ve been going through physical therapy since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that has been quite a journey for you. How are you feeling about your recovery?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It's been tough. The injury has really held me back from doing normal activities."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand how frustrating that can be. Let’s talk a bit about the ladder itself. You mentioned it was a CookFast Pro. Do you know if the ladder came with any warranty or if there was a recall on it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I’m not sure about recalls, but I know it’s from a small overseas company. They don’t really have a strong presence here in the U.S."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s helpful to know. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the company or the seller?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn’t get any insurance details. I wasn’t really thinking about that at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s understandable, especially given the circumstances. Since the ladder is from a smaller company, it might complicate things a bit when it comes to liability and coverage. But based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like there’s a clear issue with the ladder's safety."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think it was definitely defective."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It seems that way. Have you spoken with any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t reached out to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that’s good to know. Just to clarify, you mentioned the injury has been quite significant for you. Have you had any related expenses, like medical bills or lost wages, as a result of this injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, the medical bills are piling up, and I’ve missed work because I can’t walk properly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m sorry to hear that. It sounds like this has affected both your physical and financial well-being. Have you received any documentation regarding your medical treatment and expenses?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have all the paperwork from the hospital and my physical therapy sessions."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That will definitely be important for your case. Now, just to confirm, you mentioned the ladder collapsed during normal use. Were there any specific circumstances that might have contributed to the accident, like weather conditions or anything unusual?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it was a clear day, and I was just using it to reach a shelf. I didn’t do anything out of the ordinary."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s good to clarify. It sounds like you were using the ladder as intended. Since this is a product defect case, it’s essential to gather all the necessary information. Once we have everything, we can look into how to proceed."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That makes sense. What will happen next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’ll compile all the information you’ve shared today and pass it along to one of our attorneys who will review it.

This means we only get paid if you do, so there’s no upfront cost for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That’s reassuring.

I was just walking to my apartment when my neighbor's dog, a mixed-breed pit bull, attacked me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. I hope you’re doing okay now. Can you describe the circumstances of the attack? What led to the dog biting you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was just minding my own business, and the dog was off-leash. It came charging at me and bit my arm. I didn’t provoke it at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It sounds like you were caught off guard. Did you have any interaction with the dog's owner before or during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn’t see the owner around. The dog just came out of nowhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Since the dog was off-leash, it seems like there could be some liability on the owner's part. Did you manage to get the owner's contact information or any insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I did get the owner's name, but I didn’t get any insurance info from them. I think they might have renter’s insurance since they live in an apartment."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s helpful to know. You mentioned that it was a mixed-breed pit bull. Were there any witnesses to the incident who could back up your account?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, there was a neighbor who saw the whole thing. They offered to give a statement if needed."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s great to hear. Witnesses can really help strengthen your case. Now, let's talk about your injuries. You mentioned you sustained whiplash and two herniated discs. How have those injuries affected your daily life?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They’ve been quite debilitating, to be honest. I’ve been dealing with chronic pain, and it’s hard to do everyday tasks. I’ve had to miss work a lot because of it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re experiencing such pain and challenges. Have you been able to seek medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I’ve seen a doctor and gone through physical therapy. I’m still in treatment, and my doctor says it’s going to take a long time to heal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Since you mentioned being unable to work, have you had any financial impact due to your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Definitely. I’ve lost quite a bit of income from missing work, and the medical bills are piling up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s certainly a difficult situation. It’s important that we consider all of your damages moving forward. I also want to check if you’re currently working with another attorney regarding this case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I’m not working with anyone else.

Sometimes it can be tricky to find that information. Did you happen to exchange any details with anyone from the company or a retailer where you purchased it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t done that yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that’s helpful to know.

Now, have you spoken to any other attorney about this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t. You’re the first to hear about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It’s important to know. I want to make sure we have a complete picture. Can you tell me if there was any property damage as a result of the explosion?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "A few things got damaged, but nothing too significant. Just some kitchen items and the pressure cooker itself."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. It sounds like the focus is more on your injuries rather than major property damage. Are you currently experiencing any ongoing medical issues or pain related to the injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, my arm still hurts sometimes, especially after using it for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're still in pain. Has anyone from your healthcare team suggested any further treatment or follow-up visits?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They told me I might need physical therapy if it doesn’t get better soon."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It’s good that they’re monitoring your recovery. I want to go over a few more details about next steps. Since we’re gathering information, I’ll pass what you’ve shared to one of our attorneys for review. They’ll reach out to you to discuss your situation further."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. What happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Once the attorney reviews your case, they’ll contact you to discuss your options. If they believe you have a valid claim, they can guide you through the legal process. Just so you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won’t owe us anything unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! To summarize: the incident occurred on January 28th in Arizona, involving a VoltRide X2 pressure cooker that exploded while you were using it, causing lacerations that required 30 stitches. You haven't contacted the company yet, and there are no other witnesses. You haven’t spoken to another attorney, and while there was some minor property damage, your main concern is the injuries you sustained."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that’s accurate."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for confirming that. Is there anything else you’d like to add or any questions you might have for me?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think I’ve covered everything. Thank you for your help!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You’re very welcome! I’ll make sure to pass this information along to one of our attorneys, and they’ll be in touch with you soon. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You’re welcome! Have a great day!"}], "outcome_status": "dropped", "outcome_value": 0}

My name is Alex, and I’m here to help you with your situation today. How can I assist you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Alex. I’m calling about an accident I had involving an e-scooter."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m sorry to hear that you’ve been involved in an accident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. On June 29, 2022, I was charging my CookFast Pro 8-quart e-scooter when the battery caught fire."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really concerning! I hope you weren’t seriously injured. Can you tell me if you sustained any injuries from the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I did. I suffered a mild traumatic brain injury."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I’m really sorry to hear that. That sounds serious. How have you been managing since the injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It's been tough. I have headaches and some memory issues. It’s really affected my day-to-day life."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s understandable, and it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed in this situation. In order to help, I need to gather some more details. Can you describe how the fire started? Were there any witnesses?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was just plugging it in as usual when it suddenly burst into flames. I didn’t have anyone with me at the time, so I don’t think there were any witnesses."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s a frightening experience. Thank you for sharing that with me. Did you contact the manufacturer or retailer about the fire?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I reached out to them, but I haven’t heard back yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It’s important to keep records of your communications with them. Have you been able to confirm if they have insurance coverage for this type of incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven't confirmed any coverage yet. I didn't get any information about their insurance."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. It’s common for people to not have that information right away. It might be worthwhile to follow up with them as you pursue this further. Have you considered whether you’d like to pursue a claim?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I’d like to explore my options."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I can help you with that. Have you previously spoken to another attorney about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven’t had any other representation."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for clarifying that. That makes things a bit easier. Now, can you tell me if there were any damages to property or anything else involved in the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "There wasn’t really any property damage. It was just the scooter that caught fire."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. Focusing on your injuries, have you received any medical treatment for your mild traumatic brain injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the hospital the day it happened, and I've had follow-up appointments since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm glad to hear you sought medical attention. Keeping track of your medical records and expenses will be important for your case. Do you currently have any ongoing treatment or therapy for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I’ve been doing some physical therapy for the headaches and cognitive exercises for the memory issues."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds like a good approach to recovery. It’s important to take care of yourself. Now, regarding the scooter, did you purchase it directly from a retailer, or was it a gift?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I bought it online from a retailer."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for that information. It could be helpful to gather any receipts or warranty information you have for the scooter. It might support your case later on. Have you taken any photos of the scooter or the fire damage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I took some photos right after it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That’s excellent! Photos can be very valuable in these situations. Please keep them safe. Based on everything you’ve shared so far, I’ll pass this information to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. What’s the next step?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "The next step is for me to compile the information you've provided and have an attorney review it. They’ll reach out to you to discuss your options and how we can assist you further."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you, Alex. I appreciate your help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You’re very welcome! It’s my pleasure to assist you. Just to summarize, you experienced a battery fire with your CookFast Pro scooter on June 29, 2022, leading to a mild traumatic brain injury.
